- Internet connection
- Railway or cloud-hosted API server
- Git repository access

---

## Quick Installation

### 1. Download and run installation script

```bash
# On your Raspberry Pi
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/atxapple/okmonitor.git
cd okmonitor
sudo chmod +x deployment/install_device.sh

# Option 1: Install with Tailscale (recommended for remote access)
sudo deployment/install_device.sh --tailscale-key tskey-auth-xxxxx

# Option 2: Install without Tailscale (can add later)
sudo deployment/install_device.sh
```

**Note:** Tailscale provides secure remote SSH/VNC access. Generate an auth key at https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/keys

### 2. Configure the device

Edit the environment file with your settings:

```bash
sudo nano /opt/okmonitor/.env.device
```

**Required configuration:**
```bash
# Your Railway or cloud API URL
API_URL=https://okmonitor-production.up.railway.app

# Unique device identifier
DEVICE_ID=floor-01-cam

# Camera device (usually 0 for first USB camera)
CAMERA_SOURCE=0
```

### 3. Test the service

```bash
# Start the service
sudo systemctl start okmonitor-device

# Watch the logs
sudo journalctl -u okmonitor-device -f

# You should see:
# [device] Entering scheduled capture mode...
# [device] Received new config: {...}
```

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop watching logs.

### 4. Enable auto-start

```bash
# The service is already enabled by install script
# Verify it's enabled:
sudo systemctl is-enabled okmonitor-device

# Check status
sudo systemctl status okmonitor-device
```

### 5. Verify update timer

```bash
# Check that the update timer is scheduled
sudo systemctl list-timers okmonitor-update

# You should see it scheduled for 02:00 daily
```

### 6. Verify deployment

```bash
# Run automated verification
sudo deployment/verify_deployment.sh
```

This will check all critical components and report any issues.

### 7. Reboot and verify

```bash
sudo reboot
```

After reboot, wait 30 seconds then check:

```bash
# Should show "active (running)"
sudo systemctl status okmonitor-device

# Should show recent logs
sudo journalctl -u okmonitor-device --since "5 minutes ago"
```

---

## Fleet Deployment

### Option 1: Individual Installation

For 1-5 devices, follow the Quick Installation steps above for each device.

### Option 2: Clone Golden Image (Recommended for 5+ devices)

For deploying many devices, it's much faster to:
1. Set up one perfect "golden" device
2. Create an SD card image
3. Clone the image to multiple SD cards
4. Customize each clone with unique device ID

**See detailed instructions:** [CLONING.md](CLONING.md)

**Quick overview:**

```bash
# One-time: Create golden image
sudo deployment/install_device.sh
sudo deployment/prepare_for_clone.sh
# Then create SD card image on your computer

# Per device: Clone and customize
# 1. Write image to SD card
# 2. Boot and customize:
ssh mok@raspberrypi.local
sudo deployment/customize_clone.sh
```

This approach saves hours when deploying 10+ devices!

## Additional Services

### Remote Access (Tailscale)

Tailscale is **automatically installed** during device setup. If you didn't provide an auth key during installation, connect now:

**See detailed instructions:** [TAILSCALE.md](TAILSCALE.md)

```bash
# Connect to Tailscale (if not done during installation)
sudo deployment/install_tailscale.sh --auth-key YOUR_KEY
```

### WiFi Configuration

#### Option 1: Comitup (Recommended for Field Deployment)

Zero-touch WiFi setup via web interface - no SSH needed!

**See detailed instructions:** [COMITUP.md](COMITUP.md)

```bash
# Install Comitup
sudo deployment/install_comitup.sh

# Usage (on-site):
# 1. Connect phone to 'okmonitor-XXXX' WiFi (no password)
# 2. Open browser to http://10.41.0.1
# 3. Select and configure customer WiFi
```

#### Option 2: WiFi Script (For Remote Management)

Easy WiFi setup for technicians with SSH access:

**See detailed instructions:** [WIFI.md](WIFI.md)

```bash
# Add WiFi network
~/addwifi.sh "Network-Name" "password" [priority]

# List saved networks
~/addwifi.sh --list
```

## Troubleshooting

### Service won't start

```bash
# Check detailed status
sudo systemctl status okmonitor-device

# Check if camera is accessible
ls -l /dev/video*
v4l2-ctl --list-devices

# Verify pi user is in video group
groups pi

# If not, add and reboot:
sudo usermod -a -G video pi
sudo reboot
```

### Camera not found

```bash
# List video devices
v4l2-ctl --list-devices

# Test camera with v4l2
v4l2-ctl --device=/dev/video0 --all

# If camera is /dev/video1, edit .env.device:
sudo nano /opt/okmonitor/.env.device
# Change: CAMERA_SOURCE=1
sudo systemctl restart okmonitor-device
```

### Network connection fails

```bash
# Check if API URL is reachable
curl -I https://okmonitor-production.up.railway.app

# Check DNS resolution
nslookup okmonitor-production.up.railway.app

# Check network status
ip addr
ping -c 4 8.8.8.8
```

### Updates not happening

```bash
# Check timer status
sudo systemctl status okmonitor-update.timer

# Check if timer is enabled
sudo systemctl is-enabled okmonitor-update.timer

# If not enabled:
sudo systemctl enable okmonitor-update.timer

# Check last run
sudo journalctl -u okmonitor-update.service -n 50

# Manually test update
sudo /opt/okmonitor/deployment/update_device.sh
```

### High CPU or memory usage

```bash
# Check resource usage
htop
# or
top

# View service resource limits
systemctl show okmonitor-device | grep -i memory
systemctl show okmonitor-device | grep -i cpu

# Adjust limits in service file if needed
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/okmonitor-device.service
# Modify MemoryMax= and CPUQuota= values
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart okmonitor-device
```

## Security Considerations

### SSH Hardening

```bash
# Disable password authentication (use SSH keys only)
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# Set: PasswordAuthentication no
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

### Firewall Setup

```bash
# Install UFW
sudo apt install ufw

# Allow SSH
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp

# Enable firewall
sudo ufw enable

# Check status
sudo ufw status
```

### Automatic Security Updates

```bash
# Install unattended-upgrades
sudo apt install unattended-upgrades

# Enable automatic security updates
sudo dpkg-reconfigure -plow unattended-upgrades
```

---

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Log Rotation

Logs are automatically managed by systemd's journald. To check space:

```bash
# Check journal size
journalctl --disk-usage

# Clean logs older than 7 days
sudo journalctl --vacuum-time=7d
```

### Debug Capture Cleanup

Add a cron job to clean old captures:

```bash
# Edit crontab
sudo crontab -e

# Add line to clean files older than 7 days at 3 AM daily
0 3 * * * find /opt/okmonitor/debug_captures -type f -mtime +7 -delete
```

### Health Monitoring

Create a simple health check script:

```bash
sudo nano /opt/okmonitor/health_check.sh
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Simple health check
if systemctl is-active --quiet okmonitor-device; then
    echo "OK: Service is running"
    exit 0
else
    echo "ERROR: Service is not running"
    exit 1
fi
```

```bash
sudo chmod +x /opt/okmonitor/health_check.sh
```

---

## Advanced Configuration

### Change Update Time

Edit the timer file to change update time from 02:00:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/okmonitor-update.timer
# Modify OnCalendar= line (e.g., OnCalendar=*-*-* 04:00:00 for 4 AM)
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart okmonitor-update.timer
```

### Multiple Devices

To run multiple camera devices on one Pi:

1. Create separate service files (okmonitor-device-1.service, okmonitor-device-2.service)
2. Create separate .env files (.env.device-1, .env.device-2)
3. Use different DEVICE_ID and CAMERA_SOURCE for each

---

## Uninstallation

```bash
# Stop and disable services
sudo systemctl stop okmonitor-device
sudo systemctl disable okmonitor-device
sudo systemctl stop okmonitor-update.timer
sudo systemctl disable okmonitor-update.timer

# Remove service files
sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/okmonitor-*.service
sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/okmonitor-*.timer
